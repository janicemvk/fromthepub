title: About the Podcast
---

From The Pub is a free podcast from Darren Scott and Adam Wilcox. Each episode we discuss some of those really pressing issues of the day, the stuff that is on everyone's mind. The answers we're all seeking, the questions we're all asking.

[Adam Wilcox](http://adamwilcox.org/) is a small godless chap working in the less exciting end of the television industry. He has a passion for tea, carpet slippers & colonising smaller countries.

[Darren Scott](http://www.darrenscottshow.com/) is a somewhat more rotund radio professional who talks into a microphone five days a week. He loves films and drives a plastic car held together by masking tape.
